# steps to update

- Pull the changes to the repo
- navigate into the 'aits-system' folder
- use 'npm i' to install the new packages(like react-bootstrap for styling)
- link to React Bootstrap documentation is [here](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction), it'll help you with creating components so you dont have to style everything from scratch
- with new changes you use 'npm run dev' to run the server, not 'npm start'
- I've organised src folder a bit better so everything is in its own folder
- If you're creating a new page, it goes into the 'pages' folder
- If you're creating a new component, it goes into the 'components' folder
- All CSS goes into the 'css' folder accordingly
